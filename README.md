# Syntaxify
The SYNTAXIFY is an open-source project on GitHub that implements a C compiler using four phases of the front-end. It is written in C++ and generates x86 assembly code. The compiler is capable of compiling simple C programs and provides a great learning opportunity for compiler design and implementation.
